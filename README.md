## 1-Data Gathering


We fetch crime data from the [Los Angeles Open Data Platform](https://data.lacity.org/resource/2nrs-mtv8.json) using the `requests` library in Python. Here is an example of how to retrieve and load the data into a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import missingno as msno
from folium import plugins
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)
```

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. Rest assured, we are doing everything we can to fix the problem and get back to providing weekly updates as soon as possible.

## 2-Assess data

****Quality Issue 1: completeness => Missing data both datasets****

its completeness issue Quality issue there is a lot of missing values in both datasets :
data_crime_2019 dataset : there is missing values in Crm Cd 2 ,Crm Cd 3 ,Crm Cd 4 most of the columns are missing values and vict_sex,vict_descent, weapon_used_cd ,weapon_desc more than 100 K missing values
data_crime_2024 dataset : there is missing values incrm_cd_2 ,cross_street most of the columns are minssing values and weapon_used_cd , weapon_desc half of the columns are missing values.


****Quality Issue 2: Uniqueness   => duplicates values both datasets****

its Uniqueness issue in data Quality issues there is 230021 rows duplicte depand in dr_no column in data_crime_2019 dataset.


****Tidiness Issue 1: uppercase letters are used for column names in data_crime_2019 and lowercase letters are used for column names in data_crime_2024****
we have to change data_crime_2019 columns name to lower case letters and change columns to snake_case so we can index it easliy.


****Tidiness Issue 2:its Multiple variables are stored in one column****

there is muliple variables in the same cell in one columns crm cd desc the crime description and grand and many crimes
