## Data Gathering

### Crime Data

We fetch crime data from the [Los Angeles Open Data Platform](https://data.lacity.org/resource/2nrs-mtv8.json) using the `requests` library in Python. Here is an example of how to retrieve and load the data into a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import missingno as msno
from folium import plugins
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)
```
